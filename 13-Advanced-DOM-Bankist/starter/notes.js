/*
    What is the DOM?
        • Allows us to make JavaScript interact with the browser
        • We can write JavaScript to create, modify and delete HTML elements. Set styles, classes and attributes; and
            listen and respond to events.
        • DOM tree is generated from an HTML document, which we can then interact with.
        • DOM is a very complex API that contains lots of methods and properties to interact with the DOM tree.
